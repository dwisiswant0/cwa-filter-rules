This is a separate updated common web attack dataset.

Taken from the enygma/expose[1] repository and
implemented for the teler IDS[2] engine or teler-waf[3].

You are free to use the following site for testing:
https://waf.teler.app

If you think it can't fully capture the _sophisticated_
payload with the existing rules, making a PR is welcome.
